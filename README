A Python program that solves for the magnetic field of an arbitrary infinitely
thin wire geometry (or plugs in an exact field expression), and calculates the
trajectory of a charged particle with a random initial state in this field.

The magnetic field in the brute force method is solved via Biot-Savart's law.
The default particle pusher is the Boris pusher, which conserves particle energy
in magnetic fields.

The script should be Python 3 compliant except for the Mayavi library, for which
I could not find a Python 3 replacement.
